- Hash-tables or HashMaps in Python are implemented through built in dictionary data type.
- The keys of a dictionary in Python are generated by a Hashing Function. The elements of 
  a dictionary are not ordered and they can be changed.
- Hashing Function can be defined as a function which generates a "slot" or "index" to any
  key value. Perfect hashing or perfect hash function generates unique index for all the 
  key values.
